I've used UMLgraph to generate an E-R diagram out of the DAOs we use in Alitheia Core. I've just annotated a few classes with @assoc tags, removed the super class DAObject from all entities with sed, did some tweaking by hand in the .dot output, et voila, an E-R depicting almost 30 classes in less than 30 minutes!
