==UMLGraph - Declarative Drawing of UML Diagrams==

''UMLGraph'' allows the declarative specification and drawing of
UML  diagrams.
You can browse the system's documentation
through [http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/doc/index.html this link],
or print it through [http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/doc/indexw.html this link].

To install the elements required to run ''UMLGraph'', simply copy
the contents of the ''lib'' directory to a location consistent with
your installation's conventions (for example to /usr/local/lib).

To compile the Java doclet from the source code run ''ant'' on the
''build.xml'' file.

If you change the source code, you can run regression tests by
executing ''ant test''.

Visit the project's [http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph home page] for more information.
